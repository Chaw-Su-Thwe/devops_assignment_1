# devops_assignment_1
This is my first assignment of using git .

.Brief descrption : My tasks:{branching,adding new file,pushing to remote repo,merge pull request}
                    My collaborator tasks:{modifying existing file,pushing to remote repo,merge pull request}

.I branched feature/new-feature from main.Then I created a file with added text.Then I pushed the branch to remote repo then created pull request to merge to main branch.

.My collaborator is Ko Aye Min Aung. He first modified feature.txt from main then he requested pull request.later he modified the feature.txt file created in feature/new-feature . The he pushed to repo and pull request process went on.

.Thanks
